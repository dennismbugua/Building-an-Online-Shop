# The coupon_apply view validates the coupon and stores it in the user's session. We apply the require_POST decorator to this view to restrict it to POST requests. In the view, we perform the following tasks:

# 1 We instantiate the CouponApplyForm form using the posted data and we check that the form is valid.
# 2 If the form is valid, we get the code entered by the user from the form's cleaned_data dictionary. We try to retrieve the Coupon object with the given code. We use the iexact field lookup to perform a case-insensitive exact match. The coupon has to be currently active (active=True) and valid for the current datetime. We use Django's timezone.now() function to get the current time zone-aware datetime and we compare it with the valid_from and valid_to fields performing lte (less than or equal to) and gte (greater than or equal to) field lookups, respectively.
# 3 We store the coupon IDÂ in the user's session.
# 4 We redirect the user to the cart_detail URL to display the cart with the coupon applied.
